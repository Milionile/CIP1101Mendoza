            <h2 style="text-align: center;">"Liwasang Rizal/Bagumbayan"</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Also known as Luneta Park or simply Luneta, is a historic urban park located in Ermita, Manila. It is considered one of the largest urban parks in the Philippines, covering an area of 58 hectares (140 acres). The site on where the park is situated was originally known as Bagumbayan during the Spanish colonial period. It is adjacent to the historic Walled City of Intramuros.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The park's history dates back to 1820 when it was known as Bagumbayan. It became significant during the Spanish colonial period as the site of Dr. Jos√© Rizal's execution on December 30, 1896, which fueled the Philippine Revolution. The park was later named in his honor, with a monument enshrining his remains. During the American colonial period, it was the venue for the declaration of Philippine independence from the United States on July 4, 1946. Luneta Park has witnessed numerous historical events, including political rallies and the People Power Revolution of 1986. It is managed by the National Parks Development Committee and remains a symbol of Philippine history and nationalism, featuring the iconic Rizal Monument and various gardens and museums.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Luneta Park holds a special place in my heart because it is where my family and I have spent countless New Year's Eves together. During my childhood, every New Year's Eve was always exciting. We would wrap up the shop early, filled with excitement. My parents, siblings, and I would get dressed up in our best clothes, ready to welcome the new year. We would take a ride from Recto to Manila Bay and from there we would walk towards the park taking our time as we awaited the firework show prepared every year. There were also a lot of other families looking forward to the show and are there to celebrate too. I met a lot of other kids and made lots of friends back then. Thinking back, when I was a kid I never thought of it as anything special but now remembering how we spent time as a family and were having fun and escaping reality together. Well in addition to that, there were also a lot of yummy foods that my 12 year old self really liked hihi. </p>
